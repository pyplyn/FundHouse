							<strong>WHAT FUNDHOUSE DOES?</strong>

This ensures that the information that you see on our website about each member is authenticated as per proper guidelines set by the RBI/SEBI.

							<strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong>
							<p>Individuals register themselves on fundhouse as borrower or lender. Registration includes providing information such as personal, professional, financial details which fundhouse verifies. We also require documents to be submitted to verify the information provided by individuals. In addition to this, fundhouse verifies information through other available resources.

								Re&ndash;negotiate or send a counter proposal. Both borrowers and
								Investors are allowed to strike multiple deals at one point of
								time.</p>
